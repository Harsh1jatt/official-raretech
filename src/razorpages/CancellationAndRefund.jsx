      At Raretech Institute of Information Technology, we strive to provide high-quality courses and study materials. However, we understand that circumstances may require a refund request.
<br />
Refund Eligibility: Refunds are available only if requested within two days of joining the course. After this period, no refunds will be processed under any circumstances.
<br />
Non-Refundable Items: Any purchased study materials (such as PDFs or digital notes) are non-refundable, even within the two-day period.
<br />
Refund Process: To request a refund, you must email us at support@raretechinstitute.com with proof of payment and a valid reason for the cancellation.
<br />
Processing Time: Refunds will be processed within 7-10 business days to the original payment method used during the purchase.
<br />
Course Changes: If you wish to switch to another course instead of a refund, we allow one-time course exchanges within the two-day period.
<br />
By purchasing our courses, you acknowledge and agree to this refund policy.
